# GraduationRequirementsSimulation

##Purpose
The purpose of this program is to simulate a problem from the [2013 Google Code Jam finals](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/2437491/dashboard)
named Graduation Requirements. The program provides a visual representation of the problem and its solution for small input files.

##Compilation
This program was written using IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains and, as such, the best way to build the project is to import it from 
github into the IDE and use the integrated build tool. 

##Use
When the program starts, the user should pick the appropriate Google Code Jam input file and press start to begin the simulation. 
Each case must run to completion before the next one is started and the program will proceed sequentially from one to case to the next.
The slider at the bottom of the UI panel allows control of the time without impacting the correctness of the program.
